6. The command-line argument needed to compile the complete program are
	javac -d . GreetingsClass.java 
	javac -d . Chapter1.java
	javac -d . Chapter2.java
	javac -d . Chapter3.java
And as for debugging, I did have an issue trying to get the main class to recognize the classes and was getting GreetingsClass.java:11: error: cannot find symbol. Turned out I had forgot to add the import statement to the GreetingsClass.

7. The command-line argument needed to execute the program is  
java -cp . com.CITC1318.course.GreetingsClass
